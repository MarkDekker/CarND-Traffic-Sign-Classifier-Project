## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---

This is my solution to the second project in the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) [Self-Driving Car Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013).  For this project, the goal was to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images in the [German Road Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).


Structure
---
The entire project was completed in python and makes use of the [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org/) library. The implementation can be found in the [jupyter notebook](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb).

For more details on my solution and some thoughts on shortcomings and improvements, see the [project_writeup](project_writeup.md).
